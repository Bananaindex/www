  <article><u><h2 class="titlepost">Post 5</h2></u><p>Well, the UKMT <abbr title="Intermediate Maths Challenge, for years 10-11 in England."><i>IMC</i></abbr> didn't go as well as I hoped. The questions were... rather tricky. The 17<sup>th</sup> question was rather difficult. The first 15 weren't <i>too difficult</i>, but each time I say something on a test was easy something goes terribly wrong for me... I don't know as to whether I am allowed to detail anything about such questions- so I will remain silent on them until tomorrow. School was alright- nothing significant lately- results of the UKMT are yet to be released. I will release my results on here when I obtain them, I hope they are good...</p></article><br><br><br>
	<article><u><h2 class="titlepost">Post 4 </h2></u> <p>I have done practice in preparation for the UKMT tomorrow. I will speak of the paper later. I have done practice which has been to some extent, successful.</p> </article> <br><br><br>


	<article><u><h2 class="titlepost">Post 3 </h2></u>
		<p>I must say, I had a rather terrible day at school. We began with a maths lesson on a topic where I was very secure and thus bored. We have a real problem in Maths. I am estimated a grade 8, and so naturally am in the top set. However, for some reason, some students are barely passing based on the estimated grade (4) yet are still at the top, slowing down learning for the more able and adept of us, making maths lessons rather tiresome. Maths was my favourite subject until this year as a result. I believe that many consider that sessions a topic in which the class is very much secure are useless for the most part.
</p><p>Aside from Maths, our next subject was Computer Science. I'm not sure as to exactly what went on today. Our teacher seemed <b>MUCH</b> more irritable than expected. So much so that he admonished me because I was slightly slower than usual in working. The teacher then banned us from speaking for the rest of the lesson; we had to copy out the rest of our work from a PDF while he sat down on his computer or conversed with students he was angry with outside. Monday is a pretty terrible day in general for me. I have homework due for all my subjects and some homework from my tutoring (I don't get tutoring- this is once a week maths tutoring; the content is A-level rather than my current level). So that's 7+ pieces of homework. Not to mention we have a particularly long day on Monday. We have an extra hour at the end, exhausting everyone. My parents are very angry with me whenever I rush some of my homework in the morning, understandably so.</p><p> As for Geography, I generally find it boring. The content isn't of interest at the minute. It is manageable, thankfully. Now, today was different. We had only 1 Geography lesson rather than two lessons because today we had to watch a performance of a real-life story about drugs. It was of a 16-year-old who died because he had a lethal dose of MMDA. They told us about his life. I suppose it was to evoke some level of sympathy for him. It is hard to be sympathetic for someone stupid enough to take drugs. Especially such dangerous drugs. <br> Moreover, both the performance and the workshop were useless to me. Nobody 14/15 isn't aware that illegal drugs are harmful; there is a high risk of death and many unwanted side effects. So in actuality, it was simply re-affirming what I and the vast, vast majority already know. Often it has been suggested that our school should give us more practical workshops and talks- teaching us about dealing with money, buying a house. It would be far more valuable. The adults disregarded the suggestions. The school tried to set something for the 'Most Able Learners' in which the best 20 students explore things of a better nature. The frequency of such meetings in which we explore such things is low (once a month), the length of time spent on this is little (we get 20-30 minutes of this <i>per month</i>, and the first time we did this meeting the occasion we wasted it listening to a child who could barely speak, let alone explain concepts.
To top off a bad day, I failed my English Language paper. I abhor the subject as it is rather vague. I have got to go to bed now.

	<article><u><h2 class="titlepost"> Post 2 </h2></u><p>Today, I had my results back from a chemistry test at school, on the topic "Energy Changes". They were good, I got the highest score in the class in a test for the first time this year (39/45, 86.7%), so I am rather happy about that (I get money from my parents if I get the highest score in tests, however that... has dried up recently with me always being beaten by some very smart people). </p><p> I'm too lazy for revision or anything of the sort so my grades are lower than they could be- in fact on my report I failed to meet all my target grades (in fairness to myself they were ridiculous and clearly didn't account much for my previous years. The school must have known by know that I'd struggle to get a top grade in English). I've got to go to sleep- I'll finish this post tomorrow. </p></article><br><br><br>
